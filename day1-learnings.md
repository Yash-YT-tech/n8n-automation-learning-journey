# Day 1 – Foundations of AI Automation & Agents

Today was all about setting the stage for the journey ahead.  
We started with how to approach this AI Agents masterclass seriously — staying focused, taking notes, and treating each lesson like a real-world project.

I learned the core difference between **AI Automation** and **AI Agents**:  
✅ Automation is predictable, rule-based, and doesn’t “learn” — like email auto-replies, scheduled social media posts, or smart home routines.  
✅ AI Agents think, adapt, and make decisions — like Siri, ChatGPT, or even self-driving cars.

We also compared both side-by-side, understanding when each is the right choice, and why it matters. The **decision framework** we covered will help me know if a project needs a simple automation or a full intelligent agent.

Finally, the course direction became clear: this isn’t just about automating tasks — it’s about building **agents that can act on their own**.  
Next up, we’ll start exploring the tools and frameworks to make that happen.

**Key takeaway:** I now have a solid foundation — knowing when to use automation vs agents, and why that choice shapes everything that follows.
