# Day 4 – 5 Types of Nodes in n8n  

**What I Learned Today:**  

- 🔔 **Trigger Nodes**  
  - Decide **when a workflow starts** (manual, app event, schedule, webhook).  
  - Like a **doorbell** – once it rings, the workflow wakes up.  

- ⚡ **Action Nodes**  
  - Do the **main task** after a trigger (send email, add row in Google Sheets, post a message).  
  - They’re the **workhorses** of a workflow.  

- 🔧 **Utility Nodes**  
  - Help **clean, filter, and shape data** before passing it forward.  
  - Example: filtering records, sorting arrays, formatting payloads.  
  - Basically the **problem solvers**.  

- 🧠 **Code Nodes**  
  - Allow writing custom **JavaScript** when standard nodes aren’t enough.  
  - Good for advanced transforms, special APIs, or unique logic.  
  - Think of them as the **“brain”** of the workflow.  

- 🤖 **Advanced AI Nodes**  
  - Add AI power like **summarization, translation, classification, or content generation**.  
  - Like having a **super-smart assistant** inside your workflow.

**📝 Final Learnings / Insights:**  
Day 4 made me see how each type of node has a clear role.

Triggers start things, actions get work done, utilities keep data clean, code handles special cases, and AI brings in intelligence.

Together, they form a full automation engine – from simple scheduled tasks to advanced AI-powered workflows 🚀.
