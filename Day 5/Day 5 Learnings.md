# Day 5 ‚Äì AI Recruitment Workflow (n8n)  

**What I Learned Today:**  

- üìã **Form Setup**  
  - Built a form called *Team* for hackathon team members.  
  - Fields included: **Name, Experience, Language** (Python / HTML / CSS).  
  - This form collects all candidate info in a clean format.  

- üóÑÔ∏è **Airtable Connection**  
  - **Step 1:** Save candidate details into Airtable.  
  - **Step 2:** Update the same record with a rating based on language.  
  - Ratings were simple: Python ‚≠ê5, CSS ‚≠ê4, HTML ‚≠ê3.  

- üîÄ **Switch Logic**  
  - The workflow checks the candidate‚Äôs **Language field**.  
  - Depending on the value, it applies the right rating.  
  - Green lines in n8n show which path is active.  

- ü§ñ **AI Candidate Review**  
  - Used *Google Gemini Chat Model* as the ‚Äúrecruiter.‚Äù  
  - AI looks at: **Name, Experience, Language, Rating**.  
  - It then gives a **short opinion**: is this candidate worth considering or not?  

- üìù **Final Record Update**  
  - The AI‚Äôs review is saved back into Airtable in the ‚ÄúReview‚Äù field.  
  - Same record gets updated throughout the workflow, so everything stays connected.  

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Learnings**  
  - Learned how to reference nodes (e.g., `$('Python Ratings').item.json.id`).  
  - Switch conditions need exact matches (case-sensitive).  
  - AI prompt works better with clear structure and placeholders (`{{ $json.fields.Name }}`).  

- üåç **Why This Is Useful**  
  - Automates the full candidate screening process.  
  - Combines fixed rules (ratings) with flexible AI analysis.  
  - Makes hiring faster and more consistent.  

- üöÄ **Extra Learnings**  
  - Same record can be created ‚Üí updated ‚Üí reviewed step by step.  
  - Branching logic makes the workflow flexible but still joins back later.  
  - AI isn‚Äôt just automating ‚Äî it‚Äôs helping with real decisions.

**üìù Final Takeaway:**  
Day 5 felt like a **big step forward**.  

I now know how to link forms, conditions, Airtable, and AI together.

Instead of just storing data, I can build a system that acts like a **smart recruiter** ‚Äî it saves time, keeps things fair, and gives clear recommendations.
